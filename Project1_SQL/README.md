# Project Description

In this project, I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

## Presentation

This project contains a presentation with four slides. Each slide represents a question of interest, a supporting SQL query needed to answer each question and a supporting visualization using the final data of the queries.
